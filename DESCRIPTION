Description: This analysis explores usage patterns within Cyclisticâ€™s bike-share
    program, launched in 2016 in Chicago. With a fleet of 5,824 geotracked
    bicycles across 692 stations, the project aims to understand differences
    between casual riders (users of single-ride or full-day passes) and annual
    members to develop targeted marketing strategies. The goal is to increase
    the conversion of casual riders into more profitable annual members by
    leveraging insights from current usage data and customer interactions.
    This strategic focus is expected to drive future growth by maximizing
    annual memberships.
